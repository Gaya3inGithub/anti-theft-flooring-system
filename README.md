IOT BASED ANTI - THEFT FLOORING SYSTEM USING NODE MCU (ESP8266)


The basic anti theft security systems that use sensors on walls or motion
detection sensors can be avoided by using IR blocking clothes or hiding
behind objects or simply identifying and disabling them.So,we proposed this
IOT based anti-theft flooring system using Node MCU. This system monitors
the entire area for movement. One single step anywhere on the area is tracked
and user is alarmed over IOT. In this system, secure flooring tile connected
with IoT, when system is to be turn on, then whoever the comes inside the
area it passes the information over IoT. Whenever the thief enters in the area, and step on the floor immediately it is sensed by the sensor which passes on
the signal to board. The controller in turn processes it to be valid signal and
then moves the camera to the area where movement was detected and transmit
it over the internet for the owner to check the image. INDEX TERMS : IoT (Internet of Things) , Anti-theft system , Flooring
